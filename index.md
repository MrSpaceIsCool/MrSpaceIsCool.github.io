# Space Hub

Hello, welcome to the very early stages of my website. You may know me through many mediums of social media, but they all link to this website :b

Shout-out to [Tirimid](https://github.com/tirimid) for helping me out with this site.
Check out their amazing website here: [tirimid.net](https://tirimid.net)

## Get to Know Me

### The Big Deal

A lot of people know me for my music reviews, which are hosted on a spreadsheet I use. Oftentimes I did not share it because my email goes under my real name, but I have now made a backup under my public email. The link attached below is that backup.
