## Ants From Up There - Black Country, New Road

Here is where I'll post any long paragraph reviews that I feel is worthy of being here.
This will include a rating, any commendations or criticisms, and whatever else I wanna add.

The trick is to just click on the album you want to see the review for :).

This is my favorite album of all time, and I could write an essay about this album if I truly wanted to. I get that this is the pure embodiment of "male manipulator" music, but it truly is an album that I cannot see myself living without. Test test test just ensuring this works.
