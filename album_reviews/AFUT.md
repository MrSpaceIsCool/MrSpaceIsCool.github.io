## Ants From Up There - Black Country, New Road

#### Rating: Strong 10

This is my favourite album of all time, and I could write an essay about this album if I truly wanted to. I get that this is the pure embodiment of "male manipulator" music, but it truly is an album that I cannot see myself living without. Test test test just ensuring this works.
